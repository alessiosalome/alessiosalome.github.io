## Featured Projects

### X (formerly Twitter) Home Page Clone

This project is a clone of the home page of X (formerly known as Twitter), created exclusively using HTML and CSS. The objective of this project was to replicate the design and layout of the X home page, focusing on the visual elements and structure without any JavaScript or backend functionality. It serves as a demonstration of my skills in front-end development, particularly in crafting responsive and visually accurate web pages using only HTML and CSS.

You can view the project [here](https://alessiosalome.github.io/Projects/X-Home-Page-Clone/).

### Instagram Home Page Clone

This project is a clone of the home page of Instagram, created exclusively using HTML and CSS. The objective of this project was to replicate the design and layout of the Instagram home page, focusing on the visual elements and structure without any JavaScript or backend functionality. It serves as a demonstration of my skills in front-end development, particularly in crafting responsive and visually accurate web pages using only HTML and CSS.
